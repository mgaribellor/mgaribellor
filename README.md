## System Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Software Developer

I'm an experienced Systems Engineer who started in software testing in 2009 and has evolved through various roles in software development. In 2019, I founded a software startup and have specialized as a Full Stack Developer, with expertise in frontend development using Angular and backend deployment on AWS, notably crafting APIs with Lambda functions in Python. Passionate about embracing and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies, I am always looking for opportunities that welcome innovation, challenge, and continuous learning.
